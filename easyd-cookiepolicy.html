        <div class="category-desc">
            <p>At EasyD, we believe in openness and transparency about how we collect and use data related to you. This
                policy provides detailed information about how and when we use cookies. This cookie policy applies to
                any EasyD product or service that links to this policy or incorporates it by reference.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="category-title">Does EasyD use cookies?</div>

        <div class="category-desc">
            <p>Yes. As described in our privacy policy we use cookies to make sure our websites function properly and
                ensure everyone who uses them has the best possible experience.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="category-title">What are cookies?</div>

        <div class="category-desc">
            <p>Cookies are small text files containing a string of characters that can be placed on your computer or
                mobile device that uniquely identify your browser or device. Cookies allow a site or service to know if
                your computer or device has visited that site or service before. They enable the website to remember
                your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size and other display preferences) over a
                period of time, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse
                from one page to another.</p>

            <p>Cookies can also help understand how the site or service is being used, help you navigate between pages
                efficiently and generally improve your browsing experience. Moreover, cookies also help ensure marketing
                you see online is more relevant to you and your interests.</p>

        <div class="category-title">What types of cookies does EasyD use?</div>

        <div class="category-desc">
            <div class="sub-category-title">Strictly Necessary Cookies</div>
            <div class="sub-category-desc">
                <p>These cookies are essential, as they enable you to move around the website and use its features, such
                    as accessing logged in or secure payment areas,
                    interacting with our live chat system etc. Cookie consent also falls under this category as we use
                    cookies
                    to store your preferences in relation to the use of cookies on our websites and app.</p>

            <div class="sub-category-desc">
                <p>These cookies anonymously collect information about how you have used our websites. These cookies
                    help us to compile visitor statistics such as how many people have visited our website, and what
                    type of technology they are using (e.g. Mac or Windows which helps to identify when our site isn't
                    working as it should for particular technologies), how long they spend on the site, what page they
                    look at, where you click etc. This helps us learn how well our website serves you and helps us
                    continuously improve our services. These cookies also tell us how people reached our website (e.g.
                    from a search engine) and whether they have been here before. All this data is collected anonymously
                    and aggregated so we cannot identify any single user by his/her personal information.

            <div class="sub-category-desc">
                <p>These cookies allow us to remember how you were logged in, your preferred language settings and other
                    preference you have set. They also allow us to tailor our services to provide enhanced features and
                    content for you and to remember how you’ve customized your EasyD dashboard. The information these
                    cookies collect may be anonymous, and they are not used to track your browsing activity on other
                    sites or services.

            <div class="sub-category-title">Re-marketing & Advertising Cookies</div>
            <div class="sub-category-desc">
                <p>You may notice that sometimes after visiting a site you see increased numbers of adverts from the
                    site you visited. This is because advertisers, including ourselves pay for these adverts. This is
                    made possible by cookies and ad technologies such as Facebook pixel and as such we may place a so
                    called “remarketing cookie” during your visit. We use these adverts to offer special offers etc. to
                    encourage you to come back to our site. Our advertising partners or other third-party partners may
                    use these types of cookies to deliver advertising that is relevant to your interests. These cookies
                    can remember that your device has visited a site or service, and may also be able to track your
                    device’s browsing activity on other sites or services other than EasyD. These cookies also help us
                    measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign. The whole process is entirely anonymized. You
                    can opt out of these cookies at anytime.

        <div class="category-title">Affiliate Cookies</div>

        <div class="category-desc">
            <p>We have a number of affiliates who promote EasyD on a success-only basis (i.e. instead of paying for
                advertising, we pay them commissions on sales). Cookies are required to track affiliate sales hence
                allow us to reward them. These cookies are usually provided by specialist companies. We ask you to
                support us by allowing these cookies which ultimately help us to offer you the service we do at the
                price we do.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="category-title">How long will cookies stay on my device?</div>

        <div class="category-desc">
            <p>The length of time a
                cookie will
                stay on your computer or mobile device depends on whether it is a “persistent” or “session” cookie.
                Session
                cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing. Persistent cookies stay on your computer
                or
                mobile device until they expire or are deleted. You can see the details about our cookies’ expiration
                time in

        <div class="category-desc">
            <p>First-party cookies are
                cookies
                that are created by and belong to EasyD. Third-party cookies are cookies that are created by other
                companies
                (e.g. Facebook, Google etc.) and placed by us on our websites and mobile app. Third-party cookies may be
                placed
                on your device by someone providing a service for EasyD, for example to help us understand how our
                services are
                being used. Third-party cookies may also be placed on your device by our business partners so that they
                can use
                them to advertise products and services to you elsewhere on the Internet.</p>
